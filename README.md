Rough idea for a game based around accurate typing

---

## To Do
- improve flow of the game
- add styling
- add images to represent enemies
- add sound effects 
- tweak amount of health lost for missed letter
    - possiblely make health lost not a fixed number
    - possible extra health lost on consecutive miss
- maybe save high scores?
- maybe include multiple words on hard or add a higher difficulty

## Bugs
starting a new game after partially typing a word makes the game unable to progress
